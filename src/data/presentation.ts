      Hey, I'm Mike DeSocio, a cybersecurity enthusiast who loves diving into puzzles 
      and paying attention to the little things. Whether I'm building secure systems or 
      hitting the trails, I'm all about tackling challenges head-on and exploring new horizons. 
      When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me strumming my guitar, enjoying the great outdoors,
      or getting lost in a captivating video game. Welcome to my world!
