## Introduction

Greetings, I am Michael DeSocio. I possess a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from the University at Albany, State University of New York, and I am dedicated to enhancing digital security.

### Professional Journey

Presently, I serve as an Information Technology Specialist II at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services. My responsibilities include reviewing software vendors for compliance and enhancing statewide risk reduction initiatives. Additionally, I specialize in designing and implementing documentation strategies to optimize response times.

My professional journey encompasses internships at Queensbury Union Free School District and CreatorSphere Ltd. in London. These experiences provided invaluable insights into system administration and infrastructure consulting. Moreover, I have accrued expertise as a self-employed IT consultant, delivering customized security solutions.

### Volunteering and Education

Outside of my professional commitments, I volunteer at the First Baptist Church of Glens Falls to fortify network security. I am deeply involved in educational endeavors such as the Cyber Defense Organization at SUNY Albany, aiming to nurture future cybersecurity professionals.

### Personal Interests and Homelab Shenanigans

Let's switch gears and talk about something more enjoyable! When I'm not diving into the world of cybersecurity, you'll often find me strumming my guitar or exploring nature on hiking trails. But one thing that really gets me excited is my homelab.

Picture this: in my homelab setup, Proxmox, TrueNAS Scale, and docker work together seamlessly, like a well-oiled machine. And to keep things interesting, I've set up active threat monitoring with Wazuh to keep an eye on potential security risks. It's like having a playground where I can experiment, learn, and challenge myself.

Whether I'm busy strengthening network security or simply enjoying some downtime with my guitar, one thing's for sure: I'm always up for an adventure, both in tech and in life.
